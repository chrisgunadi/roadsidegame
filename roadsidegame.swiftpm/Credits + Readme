Greatest thanks to Jesus Almighty for giving me strength to rework my WWDC project amidst all the random crashes and project restarts. God knows how many times I've remade my .swiftpm file, and how many strands of hair lost in the making of my first Native iOS game.

Extending gratitude to my mentors, friends and Apple People who were there for me at Apple Developer Academy @Binus. (namely my mentors Ka Viona & Pak Haryanto who pointed me to the right direction! <3)

Also, this project of mine is done thanks to you, Mr. Gilbert Ho. I took your advice to heart and decided to learn to learn, and ditch my previous mindset of "giving up". Now I might aswell pat myself at the back. Yay to progress, Hooray to failures! (by any chance if you read this please leave me a pm on my LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-gunadi-807361240/ for fun heheh :D)


-------------

Anyways, this project will publicly be available at GitHub. If you're a future Cohort (or even public) student aiming to create something for future Swift Student Challenges, Best of Luck! My code certainly ain't the best, but what I can tell you is the feeling of relief after completing this project is a very rewarding one, despite knowing it has many flaws, I'm elated that at least I've put my best effort into this. Win or lose, this is a great way to learn to challenge yourself even further (hence CBL at the Developer Academy ;))

May Jesus Bless your journey, as he did to me.
